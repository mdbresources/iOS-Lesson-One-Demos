# iOS-Lesson-One-Demos

This repository contains demos for Lesson 1 of MDB's iOS training program, **Intro to Swift & Xcode**. Two demos are used for Lesson 1, each intending to teach students about different fundamental Swift and Xcode programming concepts. Lesson 1 Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CLfIEgeqG_ZJEX8IC45bfAgsPQjyMB-nkM2DrSX8H1Y/edit?usp=sharing).

The first demo, Playgrounds, will be used in lecture to teach students about Swift programming basics. Playgrounds contains a series a .playground folders, each demonstrating a different basic programming tool for Swift. Topics include data types and variables, arrays, control, dictionaries, functions, usertypes, and other miscellaneous basics.

The second demo, CoinFlipr, will be used in lesson to teach students how to create an iOS application from scratch. CoinFlipr is a simple iOS application which flips a coin, asks the user to guess the face of the flipped coin (heads or tails), and displays whether the user guessed the face of the coin correctly. The live demo of CoinFlipr is intended to demonstrate to students how to use the UIKit framework, storyboards, UI elements, and segues. Furthermore, CoinFlipr is live coded to give students a familiarity with the Xcode IDE, which they will be using extensively for their mini-projects and final semester project.
